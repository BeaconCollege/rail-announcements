# Important notes about these recordings

These recordings were released by ScotRail as a result of a Freedom of Information request in 2022.

They are subject to the ScotRail FOI license as followed:

```
Where ScotRail Trains Limited holds the copyright in its published information, the information may be copied or reproduced without formal permission, provided that:

- it is copied or reproduced accurately.
- it is not used in a misleading context, and
- the source of the material is identified.
```

## Errors

The released files contain some errors:

- Berwick upon Tweed has only a start/mid version
- Thetford has only a start/mid version

## Errors with crowdsourced data

Some data from [the crowdsourced transcription effort](https://github.com/matteason/scotrail-announcements-june-2022) contains errors, too.

- `1552.mp3` incorrectly transcribed as `is the delayed` instead of `for the delayed`
- `1886.mp3` CRS code is misidentified as `AXL` instead of `ALX`
- `2075.mp3` misidentified as `Lochluichart` when it's `Lochailort`
- `2338.mp3` CRS code is misidentified as `RYV` instead of `RYB`
- `2339.mp3` CRS code is misidentified as `RTU` instead of `RUT`
- Various "engineering work(s)" messages miscategorised as "conjoining"

These issues have since been fixed by myself on the
[Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jAtNLBXLYwTraaC_IGAAs53jJWWEQUtFrocS5jW31JM/edit?usp=sharing).
